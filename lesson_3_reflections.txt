When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
>> To share my code, to collaborate or just to have an online backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
>> Not always I need the exact same state locally.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
>> forks clone a repository within GitHub whereas clones copy a repository from GitHub to local resp. local to local.
>> A branch is a different version in the commit history, I.e. to test features etc.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
>> I can work on it resp. compare my current stage to the remote one when I am offline.
