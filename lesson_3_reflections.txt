When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
>> To share my code, to collaborate or just to have an online backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
>> Not always I need the exact same state locally.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
>> forks clone a repository within GitHub whereas clones copy a repository from GitHub to local resp. local to local.
>> A branch is a different version in the commit history, I.e. to test features etc.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
>> I can work on it resp. compare my current stage to the remote one when I am offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
>> I guess via commenting in the code and some email/chat messaging..

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
>> directly in master is easier, but making it in a separate branch helps having always a nicely running master branch online.
